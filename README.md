# TSEC_Mini-Project-2B---ESG-Score-Prediction-using-TensorFlow

1. Developed a regression-based machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores of companies. The model analyzed sustainability-related indicators to generate reliable predictions for corporate ESG performance.
2. Performed feature engineering and selection to identify key variables impacting ESG scores, ensuring model transparency and accuracy.
3. Implemented model evaluation metrics (RÂ², MSE) to measure performance and optimize results.
4. Designed a simple, user-friendly interface for real-time score predictions to make the system accessible and practical.
5. Focused on scalability and explainability to support data-driven sustainability insights useful for decision-making.
